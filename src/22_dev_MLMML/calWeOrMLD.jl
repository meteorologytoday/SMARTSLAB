    calWeOrMLD(; h, B, fric_u, Δb, m=0.45, n=0.2)

# Description
This function returns either the entrainment speed ``w_e`` or diagnosed MLD (Mixed-Layer Depth) if calculated ``w_e < 0``.

``h`` is the current MLD, ``B`` the total buoyancy flux at the surface, ``Δb = b_m - b(-h)`` is the difference between ML and deep ocean which is assumed to be positive (buoyantly stable), ``m`` and ``n`` the parametrization constant of dissipation. The detailed derivation and origin of the default number follow following Gasper 1988. 

Here, we also assume that all sunlight is absorbed at the surface so that ``B`` is not a function of ``h``. This makes diagnose of ``h`` during shoaling much easier.


# Return values
This function returns a list with two elements. The first is a symbol. ``:we`` indicates the second value is the entrainment speed whereas ``:MLD`` indicates the second value is the diagnosed MLD.
