# TO-DO list

- Fitting appropriate h by minimizing Q:
  - Need the residual map.
  - The meaning of h < 0
- I said total_downward_heat_flux is not the same as i thought, prove it.
- I said there are flaws in Kraus-Turner MLD derivation, prove it.
- Francois: Make Q-flux as tunable parameter to see the result.


# 2018-08-14
- Make graph of new equation including dh_dt. Still need to write the latex note down.

# 2018-08-10
- Making plots of 2 methods fitting h and Q. Should clarify these two methods in notes.
- Try to move to green planet. Some package in Julia rely majorly on python. So it is better to setup python first then install julia.

# 2018-08-09
- Did fitting h and Q at the same time. However the result is not good because it seems Q flux is negative generally in boreal summer. This is counter intuitive. What is even weird is that if we assum constant h and fit Q, Q flux will be as expected!


# 2018-08-08
- Write an NetCDFHelper to create nc file more efficiently in Julia.
- Realize the work in 08-07 is actually linear fit. The updated note is [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ffhwmpjxwbht)

# 2018-08-07

- Make the [note](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ywkvvgyzbmfn) of different approaches.
  

# 2018-08-06

- Make the note of z-average with dynamic boundary
