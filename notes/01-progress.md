# TO-DO list

- I said total_downward_heat_flux is not the same as i thought, prove it.
- I said there are flaws in Kraus-Turner MLD derivation, prove it.
- Francois: What is the difference between T_{i+1} - T_{i-1} vs T_{i+1} - T_{i}
- Do the simulation using the fitted result.

- Try to transplant the code onto GreenPlanet but still failed. Keep trying.
- Done for the case 1 and 2. For h and Q exist with constant spatial structure, there is unreasonable large uncertainty. For h only with constant spatial strueture, the uncertainty only exists near high latitude coastal regions but h can be negative in a lot of places which is not reasonable.

- Make latex note to include all the methods now i am using.

# 2018-08-14
- Make graph of new equation including dh_dt. Still need to write the latex note down.

# 2018-08-10
- Making plots of 2 methods fitting h and Q. Should clarify these two methods in notes.
- Try to move to green planet. Some package in Julia rely majorly on python. So it is better to setup python first then install julia.

- Did fitting h and Q at the same time. However the result is not good because it seems Q flux is negative generally in boreal summer. This is counter intuitive. What is even weird is that if we assum constant h and fit Q, Q flux will be as expected!


# 2018-08-08
- Write an NetCDFHelper to create nc file more efficiently in Julia.
- Realize the work in 08-07 is actually linear fit. The updated note is [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ffhwmpjxwbht)

# 2018-08-07

- Make the [note](https://www.sharelatex.com/read/ywkvvgyzbmfn) of different approaches.
  

# 2018-08-06

- Make the note of z-average with dynamic boundary
